IdleServe()
This is the background routine which does various stuff like service the link
when the MsecTick counter is non-zero. It basically does stuff in the background
which should happen once per msec.
Toggles TellTale1 every msec.

ESP32 LINK IMPLEMENTATION:
We can send command packets totalling 256 bytes, that is FIdx plus up
to 255 parameter bytes.
Looks like we can return 255 parameter bytes in one call. That means
the raw return packet with one status byte can be 256 bytes long.

ESP32 TRACE BUFFER is 4096 bytes long.

Compile time define LINK_ACTIVE if true causes link to be serviced in IdleServe()
which is called once a millisecond. It also causes Trace() and TraceLN() calls
to wrtie to TrqceBuffer. Otherwise the Trace calls use Serial.print which sends
stuff to the Arduino monitor on the USB serial port on the ESP32.


SENSEA is D35 Pin3 and services cues 0 thru 23  (HiDriveA)
SENSEA is D39 Pin4 and services cues 24 thru 47 (HiDriveB)
The SENSE inputs are biased a bit positive since A/D cannot read to 0 V.

Put DVM on Cue 0 to measure test current through 30 Ohm resistor.
Reading a bit unstable,  bouncing around 9.17 to 9.19 ma with occacional 9.07 ma
reading.
for Cue 6 measure 9.25-9.28 ma
So looks like the +12 volt supply was off on earlier measurements
now Cue 0 reads 10.13-10.14 ma, stable
Cue 6 reads 10.17 stable.

TestApp NOTES:
there is a LoggingCallbackFunction registered at startup so DLL can post
stuff to LogFile and to MessageBuffer

There is a logfile "Output\TestApp\DebugTestLog.txt" added to by TestApp
with calls to LogFile.Write. It has a message with time and date of each
TestApp startup and for bad LinkStat messages.

NessageServe() is called every ten msed in timer1_Tick().
It reads from slave TraceBuffer as long as ConnectStatusOK is true
